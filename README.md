## ðŸ“š Introduction

jation is a java reflection based event manager which uses the build in java reflection api to automatically invoke methods with parameters and eases the work of a developer by reducing the amount of possible mistakes or missing method invokations.

An event manager is a must have in big or event based applications. This project amies to optimize the event manager I previously build and which was used to power my anticheat.

## ðŸ”— Build Tools

You can use Maven or Gradle to add this dependency to your project. Therefore you have to add use [jitpack](https://jitpack.io/#Clientastisch/jation/master-SNAPSHOT) and apply the changes as documented.

Furthermore, you have to add another dependency named `refelctions` because jation depends on this dependency in order to `@AutoSubscribe` classes.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.reflections</groupId>
    <artifactId>reflections</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST</version>
</dependency>
```

## ðŸŽˆ Getting Started

### Create a new Observer

```java
JationObserver observer = new JationObserver("my.main.package");
```

### Subscribe classes

There are two different methods to subscribe a class. <br>
First of all you can add them manually:

```java
observer.subscribe(
   new TestClass(),
   new OtherTestClass()
);
```

Secondly you can add the annotation `@AutoSubscribe` to a class. <br>
However, this requires a constructor without any arguments:

```java
package my.main.package.sub;

@AutoSubscribe
public class TestClass {

   public TestClass() {

   }

}
```

### Observe methods

To observe methods you need to annotate them with `@Observe`. <br>
Another annotation `@Async` is optional to call them in the [ForkJoinPool](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.html#commonPool--) asynchronously.

```java
@Async
@Observe
public void onEvent(MyTestEvent event, @Null String additive) {

}
```

`JationEvents` can be `published` with additional parameters. In case your method uses them and there is a possiblity, that the parameter is not always defined, you need to annotate the parameter with `@Null`.

### Create JationEvents

```java
public class TestEvent implements JationEvent<TestEvent> {

}
```

### Publish JationEvents

```java
new TestEvent().publish(observer, "additional information", 5);

new TestEvent().publishAsync(observer);
```

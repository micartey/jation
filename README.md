## ðŸ“š Introduction

jation is a java reflection based event manager which uses the build in java reflection api to automatically invoke methods with parameters and eases the work of a developer by reducing the amount of possible mistakes or missing method invokations.

An event manager is a must have in big or event based applications. This project amies to optimize the event manager I previously build and which was used to power my anticheat.

### ðŸ”— Build Tools

You can use Maven or Gradle to add this dependency to your project. Therefore you have to add use [jitpack](https://jitpack.io/#micartey/jation/master-SNAPSHOT) and apply the changes as documented.

### ðŸŽˆ Getting Started

#### Create a new Observer

```java
JationObserver observer = new JationObserver();
```

#### Subscribe classes

To subscribe classes you need to call the `subscribe` method and pass the object instances to the varargs parameter.

```java
observer.subscribe(
   new TestClass(),
   new OtherTestClass()
);
```

#### Reflection pattern

To *observe* methods you need to annotate them with `@Observe`. <br>
The `@Async` annotation is optional and can invoke the method in the [ForkJoinPool](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.html#commonPool--) asynchronously.

```java
@Async
@Observe
public void onEvent(MyTestEvent event, @Null String additive) {

}
```

Events can be published with additional parameters. 
In case your method uses them and there is a possibility, that the parameter is not always defined, you need to annotate the parameter with `@Null`.

#### Consumer Pattern

Reflection is slow. Some say it is more than 100% slower than normal method invocations.
This is the result of the runtime being unable to perform any optimizations.

> This will be fixed in later versions by utilizing ASM to generate invocation code at runtime to allow the JVM to optimize the calls

Therefore, it is recommended to use the consumer pattern for performance critical projects.

```java
observer.on(TestEvent.class, (event) -> {
    // Access the event
});
```

The consumer pattern has a major disadvantage apart from scalability: Additional parameters can't be passed on.


#### Create Events

To create an event you need to implement the `JationEvent` interface. The interface has a generic type parameter which is the event itself.

```java
public class TestEvent implements JationEvent<TestEvent> {

}
```

#### Publish Events

To publish an event you need to call the `publish` method and pass the event instance to the first parameter and the additional parameters to the varargs parameter.

```java
// Publish the event to all subscribed classes
new TestEvent().publish(observer, "additional information", 5);


// Publish the event to all subscribed classes asynchronously
new TestEvent().publishAsync(observer);
```
